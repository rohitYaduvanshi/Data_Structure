Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:

String[] cars;
We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
To create an array of integers, you could write:

int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};

Access the Elements of an Array
You can access an array element by referring to the index number.

This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:

Example
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"}; 
System.out.println(cars[0]);
// Outputs Volvo

Note: Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.

Change an Array Element
To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:

Example
cars[0] = "Opel";
Example
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
cars[0] = "Opel";
System.out.println(cars[0]);
// Now outputs Opel instead of Volvo


Array Length
To find out how many elements an array has, use the length property:

Example
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
System.out.println(cars.length);
// Outputs 4

Loop Through an Array
You can loop through the array elements with the for loop, and use the length property to specify how many times the loop should run.

The following example outputs all elements in the cars array:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(cars[i]);
}

Loop Through an Array with For-Each
There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in arrays:

Syntax
for (type variable : arrayname) {
  ...
}
The following example outputs all elements in the cars array, using a "for-each" loop:

Example
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

The example above can be read like this: for each String element (called i - as in index) in cars, print out the value of i.

If you compare the for loop and for-each loop, you will see that the for-each method is easier to write, it does not require a counter (using the length property), and it is more readable.

Test Yourself With Exercises
Exercise:
Loop through the items in the cars array.

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford"};
 (String i : 
) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
